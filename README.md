# 🎶 Arduino Sound System with Keyboard, Buzzer, LEDs & Sound Sensor

This project is a creative **Arduino Uno-based sound system** that allows users to generate tones using a keypad, visualize responses with LEDs, hear them through a buzzer, and interact with a sound sensor for dynamic input.

## 🧰 Features

- Keypad input to trigger custom tones  
- Buzzer outputs the corresponding sound  
- LEDs light up based on tone or interaction  
- Sound sensor detects external noise and reacts accordingly  
- Can be used as a basic music toy or educational sound experiment

## 🛠️ Components Used

- Arduino Uno  
- 4x4 Matrix Keypad  
- Piezo Buzzer  
- Sound Sensor 
- LEDs 
- Resistors  
- Breadboard & jumper wires  
- Power source

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user presses a code on the keypad.  
2. Each code is mapped to a specific tone/frequency.  
3. The buzzer plays the tone, and the LED lights up.  
4. The sound sensor can detect environmental noise and trigger visual or sound feedback.

## 🧪 Setup Instructions

1. Connect components to the Arduino as per your wiring diagram.  
2. Upload the code from `EQUIPO.ino` using the Arduino IDE.  
3. Interact using the keypad and observe the responses.

## 🎵 Possible Extensions

- Record and playback tone sequences  
- Use a small speaker for better sound quality  
- Integrate LCD to display tone names  
- Add tempo or volume control with potentiometers

## 💻 Code

Arduino sketch included in the repository (`EQUIPO.ino`).  
Libraries used:
- `Keypad.h`
